Pure Suffering Data Pack Guide
------------------------------

Step1: Create your datapack.
- Here's a tutorial https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_data_pack

Step2: In your data namespace folder, create a folder called "invasion_types"
- Minecraft's namespace folder is named "minecraft"
- Pure Suffering's namespace folder is named "puresuffering"

Step3: Create a json file for your invasion (all lower case, replace spaces with underscores)
- Ex "phantom_zone, example_name, pain_and_suffering" 

Step4: Setup your invasion json file.
- The Invasion Values and what they do are listed below.

SeverityInfo: (List of info for each severity of this invasion, every entry is 1 more severity) {
    SkyRenderer: (Skybox attributes changed by this invasion) {
        FogRenderer: (Fog attributes changed by this invasion) {
            RedOffset: (Float)
            - Red color value offset to the default fog color.
            GreenOffset: (Float)
            - Green color value offset to the default fog color.
            BlueOffset: (Float)
            - Blue color value offset to the default fog color.
        }
        SunTexture: (ResourceLocation-String)
        - The texture used for the sun if the invasion occurs in the day.
        MoonTexture: (ResourceLocation-String)
        - The texture used for the moon if the invasion occurs at night.
        WeatherVisibility: (Float 0.0 - 1.0)
        - How visible the sun/moon is in rain/thunder.
        - Higher values are more visible.
        Brightness: (Float 0.0 - 1.0)
        - How bright the world is when your invasion occurs.
        - 1.0 for default daytime, 0.2 for default nighttime.
        - lower numbers for lower brightness.
        RedOffset: (Float)
        - Red color value offset to the default sky color.
        GreenOffset: (Float)
        - Green color value offset to the default sky color.
        BlueOffset: (Float)
        - Blue color value offset to the default sky color.
    }
    MobSpawnList: (List of mobs spawned by the invasion) {
        EntityType: (ResourceLocation-String)
        - ID of the mob for this spawn entry
        Weight: (Integer)
        - How common the mob is spawned.
        - Bigger number is spawned more.
        MinCount: (Integer)
        - Least amount of mobs that can spawn in a group.
        MaxCount: (Integer)
        - Most amount of mobs that can spawn in a group.
    }
    MobCapPercentage: (Float 0.0 - 1.0)
    - What percent of these mobs can spawn of the mob cap limit.
    - Such as 100 times 0.8 is 80% of the total mobs possible.
    - Can go higher, but is unrecommended due to performance limitations.
    ForceNoSleep: (Boolean)
    - Should this invasion force players to not be able to sleep as it occurs?
    LightLevel: (Integer 0 - 15)
    - The server-side light level of the world when the invasion occurs.
    - The values are inverted so 15 will result in a light level of 0.
    TickDelay: (Integer 0+)
    - The delay in ticks for when a mob should spawn.
    - Negative tick delay will prevent the invasion from ticking.
