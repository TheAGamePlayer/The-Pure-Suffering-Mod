Pure Suffering Data Pack Guide
------------------------------

Step1: Create your datapack.
- Here's a tutorial https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_data_pack

Step2: In your data namespace folder, create a folder called "invasion_types"
- Minecraft's namespace folder is named "minecraft"
- Pure Suffering's namespace folder is named "puresuffering"

Step3: Create a json file for your invasion (all lower case, replace spaces with underscores)
- Ex "phantom_zone, example_name, pain_and_suffering" 

Step4: Setup your invasion json file.
- The Invasion Values and what they do are listed below.
